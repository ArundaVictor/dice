## Description
The web page hosts the pig dice game. The game involves two players(Player 1 and Player 2). The two players each get a turn rolling the dice. The resulting value from the roll will be a random number from 1 to 6. The resulting number from the roll will be added to the player's total score. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player will have to forego his chance, losing his current total score and it will now be the other player's turn to play. This will go on until a player's total score adds up to 100.A player has the option to hold the game which will result to the player giving up his chance to roll the dice and it will be the other player's turn to play. The first player to get to 100 points in total or more wins the game.
